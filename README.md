ABOUT ME:<br>
•	Hey there! I'm Bhavya.<br>
•	I just started learning Python at school—and I’m already hooked!<br>
•	When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me deep in a board game battle.<br>
•	I’m also a huge fan of storybooks, especially mystery novels (got to love a good plot twist!).<br>
•	One quote I really like is: “A ship in harbor is safe, but that’s not what ships are for.” — it reminds me to keep exploring and trying new things!<br>
•	Math is one of my favorite subjects; I enjoy the challenge and logic behind it.<br>
•	I’m all ears for feedback—and always happy to help out!<br>
